# UAVs for Disaster Management

### Aim
UAV for disaster management is a project planned under IoT society of DSC IIT Patna in which we are planning to make a autopilot drone that would move in a disaster affected area and will figure out the group of people requiring help. This drone will then send GPS coordinates to rescue team making their task of locating people easy,

### Impact
This project is aimed to solve the real world problem of saving human lives in natural disasters. We intend to use drones powered with Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.
We want to developed solutions to improve the current disaster response systems by creating an end-to-end system for providing accurate and critical information as swiftly as possible to the relief task forces making there work more efficient and saving many lives.
